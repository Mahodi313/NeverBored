* NeverBored was built with razor pages, using an API from https://www.boredapi.com/
* The data from the API was saved in a database using MSSQL
* It will generate 20 activites when you first start it but make sure you have added the database in your local machine.
* It will only generate new activites if the database is empty.
* I implemented a logic for saving favorite activites using cookies, using IhttpContextAccessor Interface, instead of saving them in the database.
